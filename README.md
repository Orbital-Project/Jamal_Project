## Introduction:

**Motivation **


    Have you ever wanted to work out but did not know what to do? Have you ever wanted to eat right but had no idea how to do so? 


    Both of us used to be fitness enthusiasts and still are to this day. However, we remember the difficulties we had when we first started. Our fitness progress was inconsistent and we did not know the optimal ways to train. Things like recovery cycles and proper fitness programming were a foreign concept to us, which led to very inefficient training splits, and as a result, injuries were commonplace. We know how injuries can derail a person’s entire fitness journey, because we too considered giving up because we were afraid of sustaining more injuries.


    This was our main motivation behind creating Jamal, to advise beginners as we would advise our younger selves, so that the confusion, insecurities and pain associated with starting the fitness journey are avoided. Consequently, beginners will be able to focus on what really matters in their fitness journey – self-improvement.

**Aim**


    We aim to make an app which encourages people to embark/continue on their fitness journey, by making it a more smooth sailing experience.

**User Stories:**


    High priority > Must Have: * * *


    Medium priority > Should Have: * *


    Low priority > Good to Have: *


    A User is a general term for any one who uses our application, however, since this application is mainly geared towards those who are starting their fitness journey, most of the time, User refers to a fitness beginner.

3. **Processes:**
1. **Tech Stack**

Frontend (User Interface Design):



* Flutter

Backend (Server Side):



* Firebase
2. **Frontend Development:**

Flutter:

	



* There were 2 options which were considered for front end development, React Native and Flutter, and we chose Flutter mainly because of the following reasons:
* Well documented:
    * Having worked with React Native before, we found Flutter had much better documentation at [https://flutter.dev/](https://flutter.dev/), and also much better documentation for all of its packages, with all of them neatly available at a central location, at [https://pub.dev/](https://pub.dev/) 
* Efficient:
    * There was no need to install additional package managers, as Flutter was able to manage packages for us, even providing proper version control for all packages, so that we could install new packages without fear that they would be dependent on other versions of the current packages
* Versatile: 
    * There were a multitude of packages available for us to use at [https://pub.dev/](https://pub.dev/), which allowed us to be more creative with our UI/UX design
3. **Backend Development:**

Firebase: 



* We chose Firebase to be our backend since it was also developed by Google, along with Flutter, but also for reasons such as:
* ML hosting:
    * Since we were planning to implement a supervised learning model in our application
* NoSQL Database:
    * Allows for faster reads 
    * Flexible structure

	



4. **Challenges Faced:**

**	**



* We have faced issues regarding the implementation of an ML model in our application, as there is little to no information/ documentation regarding the implementation of a supervised learning model to workouts or fitness based 
    * We plan to overcome this problem by learning how to implement other forms of machine learning models in Flutter and Firebase, such as a machine learning model for text recognition, and then applying the concepts to our own model

	



4. **System Testing:**
* Basic Testing in Development:
    * We did basic system testing by using Android Studio and XCode, since we were using 2 different operating systems, we were conveniently able to test how our app looked on both Android and IOS.
    * We used multiple fake google accounts to test login and registration functions, in addition to testing the ability for our health tracker to write to our Firestore database
* Database testing:
    * We were able to log user credentials and particulars onto our Cloud Firestore database when a user registers an account, and update subsequently when a user either keys in their measurements or completes a workout.

![alt_text](images/image1.png "image_tooltip")

    * A user’s past workout history and measurements are kept in 2 separate collections as shown above, and we plan to display these data on the user’s home page for users to track their progress.

## User Guide:


    **Jamal’s Training Style:**


    The training style that Jamal incorporates is largely different from the conventional BRO Split that most people think of when they hear about fitness training.


    The BRO Split refers to a style of training where a person trains a different body part every day. Something like training only Chest on Mondays, or only Back on Tuesdays, is commonly seen in a BRO Split.


    **How we differ:**


    In Jamal, our training focuses on full body workouts, multiple times a week, depending on the fitness level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) of the user. An example of a weekly training split for a beginner could look something like this:


    Workout 1:


        -          Chest Exercise


        -          Back Exercise


        -          Leg Exercise


        -          Ab Exercise


    Workout 2:


        -          Shoulder Exercise


        -          Bicep Exercise


        -          Triceps Exercise


        -          Leg Exercise


        -          Ab Exercise


    The difficulty of workouts and exercises progressively get tougher as the user’s fitness improves, so do the number of weekly workouts, naturally, this means that the number of rest days between workouts decrease. Users have 2 weekly workouts if their fitness level is Beginner, 3 weekly workouts if their fitness level is Intermediate, and 4 weekly workouts if their fitness level is Advanced. Each workout is spaced apart evenly within a week, which would mean a beginner would have 3 days of rest following a workout.

**How we differ:**


    From personal experience as well as [medically reviewed articles](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-often-should-you-work-out), beginners are recommended to do full body workouts as part of their training programs. Although BRO splits are viable as well, since beginners require little stimulus to improve their fitness, given that their muscles do not receive much stimulation in the first place. However, as a beginner progresses, their muscles would need to be exercised multiple times per week to see significant progress, and a BRO split would not suit their needs. As such, the training style we use in Jamal is a full body training style, with mostly compound exercises, so that the user develops a holistic approach to training from the start of his fitness journey

![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")



    When the user first launches Jamal, he will be brought to the authentication page, where he or she can choose to sign in, if they have an existing account, or register for an account.


    **Registration Page:**


    

<p id="gdcalert4" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image4.png).

![alt_text](images/image4.png "image_tooltip")



If the user presses on the register button, he will be brought to the registration page, where his health information and personal details will be requested. Out of all the fields, the user’s fitness level is the most important. There are 3 levels  - Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced. We determine the user’s fitness level using a small fitness test consisting of Pushups, Squats and Situps. This allows users to assess their own fitness level according to the table below:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Pushups (Reps)</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Situps (Reps)</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Squats (Reps)</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Beginner</strong>
   </td>
   <td>0 &lt;= Reps &lt; 15
   </td>
   <td>0 &lt;= Reps &lt; 15
   </td>
   <td>0 &lt;= Reps &lt; 15
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Intermediate</strong>
   </td>
   <td>15 &lt;= Reps &lt; 30
   </td>
   <td>15 &lt;= Reps &lt; 30
   </td>
   <td>15 &lt;= Reps &lt; 30
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Advanced</strong>
   </td>
   <td>30 &lt;= Reps &lt; 40
   </td>
   <td>30 &lt;= Reps &lt; 40
   </td>
   <td>30 &lt;= Reps &lt; 40
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


	The user’s fitness level will determine what exercises he gets access to.

	

**Home Page:**

**	**

**	**

**	**

**	**

After registering or signing in, the user will be brought to the home page, where they can view their fitness progress on various visualisations. For the unacquainted, volume refers to the product of the sets, reps and weight of each exercise, if the exercise is unweighted, then volume is just the product of sets and reps of the exercise. For example, if I do 3 sets of 10 repetitions of push ups daily, my daily volume will be 30, while my weekly volume would be 210.


    The user can also navigate to different pages using the menu button on the top left corner of the page.

6. 
Click on the “Launch Emulator” option and choose your preferred emulator.


7. 
Run a debugging session (Fn + F5 for Mac, F5 for Windows).

### Implementation:

Most of the written code is in the lib folder. Below is how they are sorted into their respective folders.


##### Model



* 
This folder contains files required to structure data and subsequently plot them onto graphs


* 
Eg. Data streamed from Cloud Firebase will be converted to BMI objects (bmi.dart), before being plotted on the home page.


* 
Same for the different types of Exercises (exercise.dart) and Volume (volume.dart).

##### Net



* 
The functions that are required to connect to the database for information storage and retrieval are mainly stored here.


* 
Auth.dart is mainly used for authentication and logging in, while database.dart stores functions to upload and retrieve data to and from the database.

##### UI



* 
All the pages that a user sees are located in the ui folder.


* 
Eg. The first page that a user sees, to choose whether to log in or register for an account, is in authentication.dart.

##### Util



* 
Files here are mainly how the exercises are stored on the Exercises page (where users can view the different types of exercises for different fitness levels).


* 
Enum_methods.dart is used to convert Enum objects such as “fitnessLevel” and “Equipment” into strings for visualisation on the app.

##### Widgets



* 
Widgets are specific gadgets located on the app that users can directly interact with. 


* 
Examples include the side navigation menu (navigation_menu.dart), a calendar for users to track their past workouts (calendar.dart) and a search function in the Exercises page (search_exercises.dart).

### **Testing:**


#### **System testing with Users**



* 
We did system testing with our advisor Gerald, where we went through all the features of our app. Most features work as intended (remaining features have been implemented), and we took his advice on several UI designs (eg. the ambiguity of a floating button in the home page).


* 
We also did user testing with several of our friends and family, and have recorded down their experience. 


* 
Our user testing was conducted as follows:


    * Used our phones (iPhone 11 and Nexus 6) as emulators 
    * Users navigated from Authentication Page > Registration Page > Home Page > Exercises Page > Exercise Demonstrations > Workout Plan Page > Suggested Workout Page.
    * Users then filled in their comments and ratings on [https://forms.gle/Hppz7RjVcydn8Jnz6](https://forms.gle/Hppz7RjVcydn8Jnz6) 



* 
The average score for each segment is as follows:


    * Home Page: **3.4/5**
    * Workout Plan Page: **3.8/5**
    * Exercises Page: **3.8/5**
    * Exercises Demonstration Page: **3/5**
    * Suggested Workout Page: **3/5**



* 
Below are the responses we compiled from the results of our user testing. Users range from beginner to advanced fitness levels:
	

**Jia Yi (beginner):**

Home Page



* 3/5
* I feel the graphs could be more colourful, although it does seem to show me data that would be helpful in understanding my fitness progression.
* Whitespace feels abit inconsistent throughout the app.

Workout Plan Page



* 4/5 
* If I wanted to be on a workout plan, I would appreciate it if I could see the dates when my workouts are scheduled just like in this page.

Exercises Page



* 5/5
* This page has a very vibrant design, the search bar works well, and each item in the page is aesthetic.

Exercises Demonstration Page



* 2/5
* Although this page looks simple, it does appear to serve its function.

Suggested Workout Page



* 3/5
* This page reminds me of the exercises page. These exercises do appear to be doable for me. There should be a pointer to show that we need to double tap to start the rest timer.

**Edbert (beginner):**

Home Page



* 4/5
* Everything appears to be smooth, including the visualisations.
* The interface design could use some work. Opaque appbar looks quite weird.

Workout Plan Page



* 3/5 
* I feel like we should have the option to start an exercise on whichever date we choose.
* Layout looks fine though.

Exercises Page



* 4/5
* I like the way this page looks, though it appears quite different from the Home Page, which makes the entire app design feels abit seem inconsistent.

Exercises Demonstration Page



* 3/5
* The video player is functional, the UI is a little underwhelming.

Suggested Workout Page



* 3/5
* I think there should be a tooltip for new users when they use this page, also I think timed exercises should get their own timer too.

**Kar Lok (intermediate):**

Home Page



* 4/5
* I exercise quite regularly, and I appreciate the fact that I can track the volume of exercises that I do, so that I can know when I should rest, to maintain optimal gains.
* Although the visualisations appear simple, it looks clean to me.

Workout Plan Page



* 5/5 
* I have a problem with staying organised so this calendar is a perfect solution for my workout management. The layout is simple, and serves its purpose well.

Exercises Page



* 3/5
* I feel there are not enough exercises represented here, especially weighted exercises. Though I do like the interface, since it feels smooth.

Exercises Demonstration Page



* 4/5
* It appears all the videos are good examples and demonstrations of the exercises.

Suggested Workout Page



* 3/5
* I like how there is even a rest timer included here. Maybe it would be possible to include the time left till the rest is done.

**Mildred (advanced):**

Home Page



* 3/5
* Do not think there is a need for a profile picture, since it is not a social media app. 
* I do feel that the layout is not bad, though the colour scheme is a bit generic.

Workout Plan Page



* 4/5 
* I do love the functionality of the calendar, the fact that I can change the view of the calendar by tapping on the cells, to bring up an even more detailed view of the exercises scheduled on the day.

Exercises Page



* 3/5
* This is extremely useful for me, however, it is not intuitive that I need to tap the exercises to view the demonstration.

Exercises Demonstration Page



* 3/5
* Just a simple video player, nothing much here.

Suggested Workout Page



* 3/5
* I like the design of the page, I just feel that there should be some instructions letting us know that we should hold the exercise button to watch a demonstration etc.

**Reinold (advanced):**

Home Page



* 3/5
* I think the UI looks a bit tacky, sort of like an old Android app. Black and blue also looks kinda weird.
* It would be nice if we could choose an avatar.

Workout Plan Page



* 3/5 
* I think the calendar view looks a little weird, I wish there was a border around the date cells to make it appear more neat. However, the functionality appears to be good.

Exercises Page



* 4/5
* The UI looks decent for this page, I feel the images of the exercises are clipped at weird places, it would be better to choose other pictures maybe?

Exercises Demonstration Page



* 3/5
* IMO I think you guys could include instructions at the bottom of the screen for the user.

Suggested Workout Page



* 3/5
* Maybe the instructions to use this page could be shown to the user.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Changes made</span>**



* 
Improved UI based on feedback we received, such as:


    * Transparent app bar that will minimise when user scrolls upwards in the home page.
    * Ensure consistency of whitespace throughout the app.
    * Changed the theme from black-blue to white-blue.
    * Improved responsiveness of buttons by making most of them Inkwell buttons



* 
“Quick add” button on the home page was quite ambiguous, hence we decided to park it under “Do workout” instead.


* 
Initially we kept a fixed bottom bar that includes icons for different functions. However, to keep things less compact and visually more clean, we changed it to a side navigation widget instead. This way, more information can be displayed per page, which we felt were more useful.


* 
Increased the number of exercises for users 
**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Conclusion</span>**



* 
We received generally good feedback regarding the smoothness, intuitivity and functionality of our app.


* 
User testing has been successful, as we have gained plenty of insightful suggestions from our users. Most of their concerns have since been addressed.

#### **System testing across Mobile phones/platforms**

When we tested our app with several phone models that were not commonly used, we realised that there were some aesthetic issues that were not addressed, such as icons and images looking out of proportion. We have hence tried to ensure that most of these widgets and images scale according to the screen size.
